<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <strong>Auto Web</strong> project consists of creating a car sales web platform, developed with the objective of simulating a functional e-commerce system focused on vehicles. The application will allow users to browse car listings, view detailed information about the available vehicles, and contact sellers.</p>

<p>The system was conceived as part of the interdisciplinary project for the Web Development discipline, for academic purposes. <strong>Currently, the project is in the initial development phase</strong>, focusing on defining the visual structure of the application (HTML and CSS) and organizing the process through project management practices.</p>

<p>In addition to the technical development of the interface, the team adopted <strong>project management</strong> practices, using methodologies and tools such as roadmaps, wireframes, productivity frameworks, and the Kanban methodology, ensuring control and efficient collaboration among team members.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The main objective of the <strong>Auto Web</strong> project is to apply the knowledge acquired in the Computer and Control Engineering and Automation course, especially in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating interactive and responsive web applications.</li>
  <li>Integration between frontend and backend using a database (to be implemented in the next stages).</li>
  <li>Data modeling focused on e-commerce systems.</li>
  <li>Developing user-friendly interfaces.</li>
  <li>Planning and organization through project management methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For now, the focus has been on structuring the project and building the visual pages with HTML and CSS.</strong></p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS</li>
  <li><strong>Backend (planned):</strong> Node.js, Express</li>
  <li><strong>Database (planned):</strong> SQLite</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git and GitHub</li>
  <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Trello (Kanban), roadmap, wireframes, productivity frameworks</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<p><strong>Auto Web</strong> is being conceived with a three-tier architecture:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> Web interface with vehicle listings, search filters, and contact forms (under development).</li>
  <li><strong>Business Logic Layer:</strong> To be implemented with Node.js and Express.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Layer:</strong> Planned with the use of SQLite to store vehicle, user, and message information.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this moment, <strong>the team is concentrated on building the presentation layer</strong>, using HTML and CSS to structure the main pages of the platform.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>1. Project Management</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wireframes:</strong> Created to define the visual structure of the pages and the user navigation flow.</li>
  <li><strong>Roadmap:</strong> Elaborated to outline the project milestones, dividing the stages from planning to final delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Kanban (via Trello):</strong> Used for task management, allowing the monitoring of the progress of each activity.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsibility Distribution:</strong> Clear assignment of roles among team members.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Frontend (in progress)</h3>
<p>The application pages are being developed with <strong>pure HTML and CSS</strong>, focusing on responsiveness and visual organization. The initial screens of the platform have already been structured, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Presentation page</li>
  <li>Vehicle listing page (under structuring)</li>
  <li>Contact page (under structuring)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>As the project is in its initial phase, <strong>testing has not yet been fully carried out</strong>. However, the following are planned:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsiveness Tests:</strong> Verify the behavior of HTML/CSS pages on different devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation Tests:</strong> Evaluate the fluidity of the user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Functionality Tests (future):</strong> Will be performed after the implementation of the backend and database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion (Partial)</h2>
<p>To date, the <strong>Auto Web</strong> project continues to be developed, focusing on the stages of planning, organization, and the creation of the graphical interface.</p>

<p>The management tools used (such as Kanban and roadmap) have significantly contributed to the organization of tasks and the definition of clear goals. The project is progressing according to the established schedule, with the expectation of implementing functionalities in the next phases.</p>

<p>The team remains committed to the evolution of the system, aiming for the construction of a functional, well-structured web application oriented towards the user experience.</p>
